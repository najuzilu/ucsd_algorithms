## Knapsack Practice Quiz ##

1. In the TV commercial placement problem, your goal is to select a set of TV commercials (each commercial has duration and revenue) so that the total revenue is maximum while the total duration does not exceed the length of the available time slot. To state this problem as a knapsack problem, you set  
**Answer**: item value to be equal to TV commercial revenue and item weight to be equal to TV commercial duration.

2. In optimizing data center performance problem your goal is to purchase computers for a data center to achieve the maximal performance under limited budget. To state this problem as a knapsack problem, you set

## Maximum Value of an Arithmetic Expression Practice Quiz ##

What is the maximum value of an expression `5−8+7×4−8+9` that can be obtained by placing pairs of parentheses into it? For example,  
`((5−8)+7)×4−8+9=17`,  
`(5−(8+7))×(4−(8+9))=130`.  
But the maximum value is even larger! Try a few ways of placing parentheses into this expression and then check your intuition by submitting the maximum value that you've found to the field below. As you see, the questions is non-trivial already for such a small input size. But don't spend too much time on this quiz: we will find the answer to this question together by the end of this lesson; you will then be able to get back to this quiz to submit the right value. Moreover, you will be able to implement an algorithm solving this problem quickly.  
**Answer**: 200
