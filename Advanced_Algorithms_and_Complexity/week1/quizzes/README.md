**Answer**: B, E, D, S

2. What is the augmenting path that will be used by the Edmonds-Karp algorithm to increase the flow given below?  
**Answer**: S-B-A-C-T

3. Which of the statements below is true?  
**Answer**:
* The sum of the capacities of the edges of a network equals the sum of the capacities of the edges of any residual network.
* The Ford-Fulkerson algorithms runs in polynomial time on graphs with unit edge capacities.

4. What is the size of the maximum matching of the following graph?  
**Answer**: 4

5. Consider the image segmentation problem on a picture that is given by an n by n grid of pixels. Suppose that separation penalties are imposed only for adjacent pairs of pixels. If we use the Edmonds-Karp algorithm to solve this problem as described in class, the final runtime is O(n^a) for some a. What is the best such a?  
**Answer**: 6
